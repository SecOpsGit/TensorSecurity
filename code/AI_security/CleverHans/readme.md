一匹叫做 Clever Hans 的馬。剛出現的時候人們認為這匹馬會做算術，
但實際上它只是會閱讀人的表情，
當它點馬蹄的次數接近正確答案時，人們的表情會更興奮，
它就知道該這個時候停止了。

CleverHans is a software library that provides standardized reference implementations 
of adversarial example construction techniques and adversarial training. 

The library may be used to develop more robust machine learning models 
and to provide standardized benchmarks of models' performance in the adversarial setting. 

Benchmarks constructed without a standardized implementation of adversarial example construction 
are not comparable to each other, because a good result may indicate a robust model 
or it may merely indicate a weak implementation of the adversarial example construction procedure.

This technical report is structured as follows. 
Section 1 provides an overview of adversarial examples in machine learning and of the CleverHans software. 
Section 2 presents the core functionalities of the library: 
namely the attacks based on adversarial examples 
and defenses to improve the robustness of machine learning models to these attacks. 
Section 3 describes how to report benchmark results using the library. 
Section 4 describes the versioning system.
