Several organizations maintain and publish free blocklists (a.k.a blacklists) of IP addresses and URLs of systems 
and networks suspected in malicious activities on-line. 
Some of these lists have usage restrictions:

Learning detectors of malicious web requests for intrusion detection in network traffic
Lukas Machlica, Karel Bartos, Michal Sofka
(Submitted on 8 Feb 2017)

This paper proposes a generic classification system designed to detect security threats based on the behavior of malware samples. 

The system relies on statistical features computed from proxy log fields to train detectors using a database of malware samples. 
The behavior detectors serve as basic reusable building blocks of the multi-level detection architecture. 
The detectors identify malicious communication exploiting encrypted URL strings 
and domains generated by a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) which are frequently used in 
Command and Control (C&C), phishing, and click fraud. 

Surprisingly, very precise detectors can be built given only a limited amount of information extracted from a single proxy log. 

This way, the computational requirements of the detectors are kept low which allows for deployment 
on a wide range of security devices and without depending on traffic context such as DNS logs, Whois records, webpage content, etc. 

Results on several weeks of live traffic from 100+ companies having 350k+ hosts show correct detection 
with a precision exceeding 95% of malicious flows, 95% of malicious URLs and 90% of infected hosts. 

In addition, a comparison with a signature and rule-based solution shows that our system is able to 
detect significant amount of new threats.
