DeepSign: Deep Learning for Automatic Malware Signature Generation and Classification
Eli David, Nathan S. Netanyahu
(Submitted on 21 Nov 2017 (v1), last revised 23 Nov 2017 (this version, v2))

automatic malware signature generation and classification. 
uses a deep belief network (DBN), implemented with a deep stack of denoising autoencoders, 
generating an invariant compact representation of the malware behavior.
