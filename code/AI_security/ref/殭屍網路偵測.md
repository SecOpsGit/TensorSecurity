為了提高 Bot 回報的成功率，駭客採用DGA(Domain Generation Algorithm)技術來動態產生連接與回報用的網域名稱，
讓Bot可以不斷嘗試透過合法的DNS服務與重要的C2 Server或是Proxy伺服器連接，進而提升整體 Botnet 的壽命。

An AI-based, Multi-stage detection system of banking botnets
Li Ling, Zhiqiang Gao, Michael A Silas, Ian Lee, Erwan A Le Doeuff
(Submitted on 18 Jul 2019 (v1), last revised 25 Jul 2019 (this version, v3))

Banking Trojans, botnets are primary drivers of financially-motivated cybercrime. 

In this paper, we first analyzed how an APT-based banking botnet works step by step through the whole lifecycle. 
Specifically, we present a multi-stage system that detects malicious banking botnet activities 
which potentially target the organizations. 
The system leverages Cyber Data Lake as well as multiple artificial intelligence techniques at different stages. 
The evaluation results using public datasets showed that Deep Learning based detections were highly successful 
compared with baseline models.

RTbust: Exploiting Temporal Patterns for Botnet Detection on Twitter
Michele Mazza, Stefano Cresci, Marco Avvenuti, Walter Quattrociocchi, Maurizio Tesconi
(Submitted on 12 Feb 2019)

Within OSNs, many of our supposedly online friends may instead be fake accounts called social bots, part of large groups that purposely re-share targeted content. Here, we study retweeting behaviors on Twitter, with the ultimate goal of detecting retweeting social bots. We collect a dataset of 10M retweets. We design a novel visualization that we leverage to highlight benign and malicious patterns of retweeting activity. In this way, we uncover a 'normal' retweeting pattern that is peculiar of human-operated accounts, and 3 suspicious patterns related to bot activities. Then, we propose a bot detection technique that stems from the previous exploration of retweeting behaviors. Our technique, called Retweet-Buster (RTbust), leverages unsupervised feature extraction and clustering. An LSTM autoencoder converts the retweet time series into compact and informative latent feature vectors, which are then clustered with a hierarchical density-based algorithm. Accounts belonging to large clusters characterized by malicious retweeting patterns are labeled as bots. RTbust obtains excellent detection results, with F1 = 0.87, whereas competitors achieve F1 < 0.76. Finally, we apply RTbust to a large dataset of retweets, uncovering 2 previously unknown active botnets with hundreds of accounts.
