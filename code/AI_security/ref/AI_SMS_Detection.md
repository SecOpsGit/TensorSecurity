Machine Learning for E-mail Spam Filtering: Review,Techniques and Trends
Alexy Bhowmick, Shyamanta M. Hazarika
(Submitted on 3 Jun 2016)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01042

We present a comprehensive review of the most effective content-based e-mail spam filtering techniques. 

We focus primarily on Machine Learning-based spam filters and their variants, 
and report on a broad review ranging from surveying the relevant ideas, efforts, effectiveness, and the current progress. 

The initial exposition of the background examines the basics of e-mail spam filtering, the evolving nature of spam, spammers playing cat-and-mouse with e-mail service providers (ESPs), and the Machine Learning front in fighting spam. 

We conclude by measuring the impact of Machine Learning-based filters and explore the promising offshoots of latest developments.

An intelligent system for spam detection and identification of the most relevant features 
based on evolutionary Random Weight Networks

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1566253518303968

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inffus.2018.08.002

Highlights
•In this paper, an evolvable and adaptable spam detection models is proposed.
•The proposed system is based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Random Weight Network (RWN).
• The system automaticly identifies the relevant features for classifying spam emails.
•Extensive experiments based on three email corpora were conducted to evaluate the proposed system.
•A superior performance of the proposed approaches is proved in the experiments.
