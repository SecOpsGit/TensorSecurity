 6 supervised classification models, i.e., Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), 
 Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), 
 
 as well as 4 unsupervised anomaly detection models, i.e., 
 One-Class SVM (OCSVM), 
 Auto-Encoder (AE), 
 Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), and 
 Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), are explored in this study.
 
 We train all these models on a public credit card transaction dataset from Kaggle website, 
 which contains 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. 
 
 The labels of the transactions are used for supervised learning models only. 
 
 The performance of each model is evaluated through 5-fold cross validation 
 in terms of Area Under the Receiver Operating Curves (AUROC). 
 
 Within supervised approaches, XGB and RF obtain the best performance with AUROC = 0.989 and AUROC = 0.988, respectively. 
 While for unsupervised approaches, RBM achieves the best performance with AUROC = 0.961, 
 followed by GAN with AUROC = 0.954. 
 
 The experimental results show that supervised models perform slightly better than unsupervised models in this study. 
 
 Anyway, unsupervised approaches are still promising for credit card fraud transaction detection 
 due to the insufficient annotation and the data imbalance issue in real-world applications.
