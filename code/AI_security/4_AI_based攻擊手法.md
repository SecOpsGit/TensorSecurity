Image steganography is dedicated to hiding secret messages in digital images, 
and has achieved the purpose of covert communication. 

Recently, research on image steganography has demonstrated great potential for using GAN and neural networks. 

In this paper we review different strategies for steganography such as cover modification, 
cover selection and cover synthesis by GANs, 
and discuss the characteristics of these methods as well as evaluation metrics 
and provide some possible future research directions in image steganography.

SynGAN: Towards Generating Synthetic Network Attacks using GANs

SynGAN, a framework that generates adversarial network attacks using the Generative Adversial Networks (GAN). 
SynGAN generates malicious packet flow mutations using real attack traffic, which can improve NIDS attack detection rates. 
As a first step, we compare two public datasets, NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017, 
for generating synthetic Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) network attacks. 

We evaluate the attack quality (real vs. synthetic) using a gradient boosting classifier.
