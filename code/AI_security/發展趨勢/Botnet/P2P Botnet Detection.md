RTbust: Exploiting Temporal Patterns for Botnet Detection on Twitter

(Submitted on 12 Feb 2019)

Within OSNs, many of our supposedly online friends may instead be fake accounts called social bots, 
part of large groups that purposely re-share targeted content. 
Here, we study retweeting behaviors on Twitter, 
with the ultimate goal of detecting retweeting social bots. We collect a dataset of 10M retweets. 

We design a novel visualization that we leverage to highlight benign and 
malicious patterns of retweeting activity. 

In this way, we uncover a 'normal' retweeting pattern that is peculiar of human-operated accounts, 
and 3 suspicious patterns related to bot activities. 

Then, we propose a bot detection technique that stems from 
the previous exploration of retweeting behaviors. Our technique, 
called Retweet-Buster (RTbust), leverages unsupervised feature extraction and clustering. 

An LSTM autoencoder converts the retweet time series into compact 
and informative latent feature vectors, which are then clustered with 
a hierarchical density-based algorithm. 

Accounts belonging to large clusters characterized by malicious retweeting patterns 
are labeled as bots. RTbust obtains excellent detection results, 
with F1 = 0.87, whereas competitors achieve F1 < 0.76. 

Finally, we apply RTbust to a large dataset of retweets, 
uncovering 2 previously unknown active botnets with hundreds of accounts.
