Image steganography is dedicated to hiding secret messages in digital images, 
and has achieved the purpose of covert communication. 

Recently, research on image steganography has demonstrated great potential for using GAN and neural networks. 

In this paper we review different strategies for steganography such as cover modification, 
cover selection and cover synthesis by GANs, 
and discuss the characteristics of these methods as well as evaluation metrics 
and provide some possible future research directions in image steganography.

a stego-security classification is proposed based on the four levels of steganalysis attacks:
a) Stego-Cover Only Attack (SCOA): the steganalysis attacker can only access a set of stego-covers.
b) Known Cover Attack (KCA): being able to perform SCOA, the attacker can also obtain
some original cover carriers and their corresponding stego carriers. Within polynomial complexity, the
number of pairs is limited.
c) Chosen Cover Attack (CCA): an attacker can use the steganographic algorithm to
perform multiple message embedding and extraction operations with a priori knowledge under KCA.
Within polynomial complexity, the number of invocation operations is limited.

d) Adaptive Chosen Cover Attack (ACCA): The ACCA mode means that when the CCA mode
challenge fails, another CCA attacks can be performed until the attack is successful.
