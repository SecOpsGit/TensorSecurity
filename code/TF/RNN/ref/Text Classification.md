We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained 
on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks. 

We show that a simple CNN with little hyperparameter tuning and static vectors 
achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks. 

Learning task-specific vectors through fine-tuning offers further gains in performance. 

We additionally propose a simple modification to the architecture to allow for the use of both task-specific and static vectors. 
The CNN models discussed herein improve upon the state of the art on 4 out of 7 tasks, 
which include sentiment analysis and question classification.

Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification

This article offers an empirical exploration on the use of character-level convolutional networks (ConvNets) for text classification. 

We constructed several large-scale datasets to show that character-level convolutional networks 
could achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results. 

Comparisons are offered against traditional models such as bag of words, n-grams and their TFIDF variants, 
and deep learning models such as word-based ConvNets and recurrent neural networks.

Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Text Classification

(Submitted on 6 Jun 2016 (v1), last revised 27 Jan 2017 (this version, v2))

We present a new architecture (VDCNN) for text processing which operates directly at the character level 
and uses only small convolutions and pooling operations. 

We are able to show that the performance of this model increases with depth: 
using up to 29 convolutional layers, 

we report improvements over the state-of-the-art on several public text classification tasks. 

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that very deep convolutional nets have been applied to text processing.
