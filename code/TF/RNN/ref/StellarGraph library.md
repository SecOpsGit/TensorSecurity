StellarGraph is a Python library for machine learning on graph-structured (or equivalently, network-structured) data.



Graph-structured data represent entities, e.g., people, as nodes (or equivalently, vertices), 
and relationships between entities, e.g., friendship, as links (or equivalently, edges). 
Nodes and links may have associated attributes such as age, income, 
and time when a friendship was established, etc. 

StellarGraph supports analysis of both homogeneous networks (with nodes and links of one type) 
and heterogeneous networks (with more than one type of nodes and/or links).

The StellarGraph library implements several state-of-the-art algorithms for applying machine learning methods 
to discover patterns and answer questions using graph-structured data.

The StellarGraph library can be used to solve tasks using graph-structured data, such as:

Representation learning for nodes and edges, to be used for visualisation and various downstream machine learning tasks;
Classification and attribute inference of nodes or edges;
Link prediction;
Interpretation of node classification through calculated importances of edges and neighbour nodes for selected target nodes .
We provide examples of using StellarGraph to solve such tasks using several real-world datasets.
