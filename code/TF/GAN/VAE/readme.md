How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models, 
in the presence of continuous latent variables 
with intractable posterior distributions, and large datasets? 

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm 
that scales to large datasets and, 
under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. 

Our contributions is two-fold. 

First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator 
that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. 

Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, 
posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model 
(also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. 

Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.

An Introduction to Variational Autoencoders
Diederik P. Kingma, Max Welling
(Submitted on 6 Jun 2019 (v1), last revised 24 Jul 2019 (this version, v2))

Variational autoencoders provide a principled framework for learning deep latent-variable models 
and corresponding inference models. 

In this work, we provide an introduction to variational autoencoders and some important extensions.
